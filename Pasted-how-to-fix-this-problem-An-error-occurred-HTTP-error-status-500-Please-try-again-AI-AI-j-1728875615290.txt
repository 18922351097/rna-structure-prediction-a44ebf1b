A 500 HTTP error usually indicates that there's a problem on the server-side. Based on the provided code snippets, I can suggest some steps to diagnose and potentially fix the issue:

Check the Server Code: Review the server-side code, especially the /predict endpoint in app.py. Ensure all potential exceptions are properly caught and logged. Hereâ€™s a snippet that shows where the error might be happening in the predict() function:

try:
    print("Received POST request to /predict")
    sequence = request.form['sequence']
    ....
    # Other code for prediction and generating response
    
    return jsonify(response_data)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error in predict route: {str(e)}")
    return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500
Enable Detailed Logging: Ensure that any exceptions are being logged with their stack traces. This can provide more insight into what is causing the server-side error.

Verify External Dependencies:

Ensure that any external libraries or services used in the prediction function are working correctly. For example, make sure libraries like RNA for folding and fgb.BulgeGraph for generating graph data are correctly installed and configured.
Validate that paths like plt.text and plt.savefig are working without issues.
Validate Input Data:

Ensure that the input data being passed, particularly the sequence, is valid and isn't causing any unexpected behavior in the prediction logic.
Add validation logic in the server-side before processing the RNA sequence.
User Feedback and Retries:

Provide more specific error messages by enhancing the catch block in rna_viz.js to handle specific cases.
.catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    loading.style.display = 'none';
    errorMessage.textContent = `An error occurred: ${error.message}. Please try again.`;
    errorMessage.style.display = 'block';
});
Test Locally: Run the application locally, where you can easily debug and get more detailed logs than in a production environment.

With these steps, you should be able to trace and potentially resolve the source of the 500 error. If the problem persists, consider checking log files or configurations that might not be visible in the code snippets provided.
