The error message "node not found: s" suggests that there might be an issue with accessing or processing a specific node identified by 's' in your graph-related function, possibly within the createForceGraph function in rna_viz.js.

Hereâ€™s how you can address this issue:

Verify Graph Data: Ensure that the graphData passed to createForceGraph contains all the expected nodes. It should include a node with an ID that matches what is being searched for. Log the graphData to verify its contents:

console.log('Graph data nodes:', graphData.nodes);
console.log('Graph data links:', graphData.links);
Check Node IDs: Ensure that the nodes have unique and correctly formatted IDs. The ID associated with each node should match how these nodes are referenced in any links (edges) or elsewhere in your code.

Update Links: In the force graph, nodes and links should coordinate properly where source and target IDs in links must match the id fields in nodes. Confirm that all expected nodes are present.

Error Handling: Enhance the error handling in createForceGraph to fall back gracefully if expected nodes do not exist:

const simulation = d3.forceSimulation(graphData.nodes || [])
    .force("link", d3.forceLink(graphData.links || []).id(d => {
        if (!d) {
            console.error('Link with empty node:', d);
            return 'missing';
        }
        return d.id;
    }))
    .force("charge", d3.forceManyBody().strength(-100))
    .force("center", d3.forceCenter(width / 2, height / 2));
Debugging: If possible, debug step-by-step to see when 's' is being searched for but not found. Check if 's' is genuinely part of any initial data structures you utilize to create your graph.

Following these steps should help you troubleshoot and address the error concerning the missing node 's'. If 's' represents a legitimate node, ensure proper data setup and handling across your application
